    "Anyway, I'm glad you're here; we\nwouldn't have been able to get Gregor to open the door by ourselves;\nhe's so stubborn; and I'm sure he isn't well, he said this morning that\nhe is, but he isn't.\" \"I'll be there in a moment\", said Gregor slowly\nand thoughtfully, but without moving so that he would not miss any word\nof the conversation.",
    "During the five years that he had not been working - the\nfirst holiday in a life that had been full of strain and no success - he\nhad put on a lot of weight and become very slow and clumsy.",
    "So now Gregor was shut out\nfrom his mother, who, because of him, might be near to death; he could\nnot open the door if he did not want to chase his sister away, and she\nhad to stay with his mother; there was nothing for him to do but wait;\nand, oppressed with anxiety and self-reproach, he began to crawl about,\nhe crawled over everything, walls, furniture, ceiling, and finally in\nhis confusion as the whole room began to spin around him he fell down\ninto the middle of the dinner table.",
    "He sits with us in\nthe kitchen and just reads the paper or studies train timetables.",
    "Would she notice that he had left\nthe milk as it was, realise that it was not from any lack of hunger and\nbring him in some other food that was more suitable?",
    "Samsa to her\ncontractor and Grete to her principal.",
    "The greatest improvement for\nthe time being, of course, would be achieved quite easily by moving\nhouse; what they needed now was a flat that was smaller and cheaper\nthan the current one which had been chosen by Gregor, one that was in a\nbetter location and, most of all, more practical.",
    "If he could just understand us\", repeated Gregor's father, closing his\neyes in acceptance of his sister's certainty that that was quite\nimpossible, \"then perhaps we could come to some kind of arrangement\nwith him.",
    "Gregor hardly slept at all, either night or day.",
    "One time,\nthough, the charwoman left the door to the living room slightly open,\nand it remained open when the gentlemen who rented the room came in in\nthe evening and the light was put on.",
    "Samsa as if he had been suddenly overcome with humility and wanted\npermission again from Mr.",
    "He's enjoyed his\ndinner today\", she might say when he had diligently cleared away all\nthe food left for him, or if he left most of it, which slowly became\nmore and more frequent, she would often say, sadly, \"now everything's\njust been left there again\".",
    "Didn't you want to go\nsomewhere?\" That gentle voice!",
    "And the chief clerk was a lover of women,\nsurely she could persuade him; she would close the front door in the\nentrance hall and talk him out of his shocked state.",
    "He had come very close to\nforgetting, and it had only been the voice of his mother, unheard for\nso long, that had shaken him out of it.",
    "As it is\nthis animal is persecuting us, it's driven out our tenants, it\nobviously wants to take over the whole flat and force us to sleep on\nthe streets.",
    "Only\nthen would he consider what to do next, as he was well aware that he\nwould not bring his thoughts to any sensible conclusions by lying in\nbed.",
    "It showed a lady fitted out with a fur\nhat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered\nthe whole of her lower arm towards the viewer.",
    "I know that nobody likes the travellers.",
    "She quickly dropped it all\ninto a bin, closed it with its wooden lid, and carried everything out.",
    "He moved very gradually, as if there had been\nsome secret prohibition on leaving the room.",
    "Samsa, we cannot allow there to be.\"\n\n\"But Sir\", called Gregor, beside himself and forgetting all else in the\nexcitement, \"I'll open up immediately, just a moment.",
    "He pushed himself over to\nthe door, feeling his way clumsily with his antennae - of which he was\nnow beginning to learn the value - in order to see what had been\nhappening there.",
    "There were old, half-rotten\nvegetables; bones from the evening meal, covered in white sauce that\nhad gone hard; a few raisins and almonds; some cheese that Gregor had\ndeclared inedible two days before; a dry roll and some bread spread\nwith butter and salt.",
    "They had been good\ntimes and they had never come again, at least not with the same\nsplendour, even though Gregor had later earned so much that he was in a\nposition to bear the costs of the whole family, and did bear them.",
    "She had probably only\njust got up and had not even begun to get dressed.",
    "So, as she was prevented from telling them\nall about it, she suddenly remembered what a hurry she was in and,\nclearly peeved, called out \"Cheerio then, everyone\", turned round\nsharply and left, slamming the door terribly as she went.",
    "Gregor's sister was exhausted from going out to work, and looking after\nGregor as she had done before was even more work for her, but even so\nhis mother ought certainly not to have taken her place.",
    "Samsa were struck, almost simultaneously, with the thought of how their\ndaughter was blossoming into a well built and beautiful young lady.",
    "Gregor slowly pushed his way over to the door with the chair.",
    "You barricade yourself in your room, give us no more\nthan yes or no for an answer, you are causing serious and unnecessary\nconcern to your parents and you fail - and I mention this just by the\nway - you fail to carry out your business duties in a way that is quite\nunheard of.",
    "Now, this was not something that she would be able to do by\nherself; she did not dare to ask for help from her father; the sixteen\nyear old maid had carried on bravely since the cook had left but she\ncertainly would not have helped in this, she had even asked to be\nallowed to keep the kitchen locked at all times and never to have to\nopen the door unless it was especially important; so his sister had no\nchoice but to choose some time when Gregor's father was not there and\nfetch his mother to help her.",
    "The family themselves ate in the kitchen.",
    "Gregor made a run for him; he wanted to be sure of\nreaching him; the chief clerk must have expected something, as he leapt\ndown several steps at once and disappeared; his shouts resounding all\naround the staircase.",
    "This elderly widow, with a robust bone structure that made her\nable to withstand the hardest of things in her long life, wasn't really\nrepelled by Gregor.",
    "He was determined to make his way forward to his sister\nand tug at her skirt to show her she might come into his room with her\nviolin, as no-one appreciated her playing here as much as he would.",
    "Samsa merely\nopened his eyes wide and briefly nodded to him several times.",
    "His observant\nsister only needed to notice the chair twice before she would always\npush it back to its exact position by the window after she had tidied\nup the room, and even left the inner pane of the window open from then\non.",
    "Seven o'clock, already\", he said to himself when the clock\nstruck again, \"seven o'clock, and there's still a fog like this.\" And\nhe lay there quietly a while longer, breathing lightly as if he perhaps\nexpected the total stillness to bring things back to their real and\nnatural state.",
    "His sister, unfortunately, did not agree; she had become used to the\nidea, not without reason, that she was Gregor's spokesman to his\nparents about the things that concerned him.",
    "He was still hurriedly thinking all this through, unable to decide to\nget out of the bed, when the clock struck quarter to seven.",
    "Gregor got out.\" \"Just as I expected\", said his father,\n\"just as I always said, but you women wouldn't listen, would you.\" It\nwas clear to Gregor that Grete had not said enough and that his father\ntook it to mean that something bad had happened, that he was\nresponsible for some act of violence.",
    "You've got to get enough sleep.",
    "No-one dared to remove the apple lodged in Gregor's flesh, so it\nremained there as a visible reminder of his injury.",
    "But it was something that had to be risked.",
    "It was not very clear how much she knew of what had happened but\nshe left within a quarter of an hour, tearfully thanking Gregor's\nmother for her dismissal as if she had done her an enormous service.",
    "Gregor's father staggered back to his seat, feeling his way with his\nhands, and fell into it; it looked as if he was stretching himself out\nfor his usual evening nap but from the uncontrolled way his head kept\nnodding it could be seen that he was not sleeping at all.",
    "She\nran into the other room to fetch some kind of smelling salts to bring\nher mother out of her faint; Gregor wanted to help too - he could save\nhis picture later, although he stuck fast to the glass and had to pull\nhimself off by force; then he, too, ran into the next room as if he\ncould advise his sister like in the old days; but he had to just stand\nbehind her doing nothing; she was looking into various bottles, he\nstartled her when she turned round; a bottle fell to the ground and\nbroke; a splinter cut Gregor's face, some kind of caustic medicine\nsplashed all over him; now, without delaying any longer, Grete took\nhold of all the bottles she could and ran with them in to her mother;\nshe slammed the door shut with her foot.",
    "For the days that I have been living here I will, of course,\npay nothing at all, on the contrary I will consider whether to proceed\nwith some kind of action for damages from you, and believe me it would\nbe very easy to set out the grounds for such an action.\" He was silent\nand looked straight ahead as if waiting for something.",
    "The chest of drawers was something that Gregor could do without if\nhe had to, but the writing desk had to stay.",
    "That's what I\nsaid\", replied the cleaner, and to prove it she gave Gregor's body\nanother shove with the broom, sending it sideways across the floor.",
    "This picture at\nleast, now totally covered by Gregor, would certainly be taken away by\nno-one.",
    "What is it you want then?\", asked Mrs.",
    "Well I can't think of any other way of explaining\nit, Mrs.",
    "Samsa appeared in his\nuniform with his wife on one arm and his daughter on the other.",
    "For instance, whenever I go\nback to the guest house during the morning to copy out the contract,\nthese gentlemen are always still sitting there eating their breakfasts.",
    "Their business misfortune had reduced the\nfamily to a state of total despair, and Gregor's only concern at that\ntime had been to arrange things so that they could all forget about it\nas quickly as possible.",
    "He felt that he had\nbeen drawn back in among people, and from the doctor and the locksmith\nhe expected great and surprising achievements - although he did not\nreally distinguish one from the other.",
    "It was his sister who had been in\nso much of a rush.",
    "He had suffered it\nthere for more than a month, and his condition seemed serious enough to\nremind even his father that Gregor, despite his current sad and\nrevolting form, was a family member who could not be treated as an\nenemy.",
    "In itself, his sister's not coming into the room would have\nbeen no surprise for Gregor as it would have been difficult for her to\nimmediately open the window while he was still there, but not only did\nshe not come in, she went straight back and closed the door behind her,\na stranger would have thought he had threatened her and tried to bite\nher.",
    "But then of\ncourse, the maid's firm steps went to the door as ever and opened it.",
    "That meant Gregor would now have\nto try to calm his father, as he did not have the time to explain\nthings to him even if that had been possible.",
    "He isn't well\", said his\nmother to the chief clerk, while his father continued to speak through\nthe door.",
    "He\nwas pleased when he finally had his head in front of the doorway, but\nthen saw that it was too narrow, and his body was too broad to get\nthrough it without further difficulty.",
    "Alright, we'll go then\", he said, and looked up at Mr.",
    "We\ncan't all work as hard as we have to and then come home to be tortured\nlike this, we can't endure it.",
    "Perhaps this was what\ntempted Grete to make Gregor's situation seem even more shocking than\nit was so that she could do even more for him.",
    "At first he moved it\nbecause, with no other room free where he could crawl about, he was\nforced to, but later on he came to enjoy it although moving about in\nthat way left him sad and tired to death, and he would remain immobile\nfor hours afterwards.",
    "When Gregor was already sticking half way out of the bed - the new method\nwas more of a game than an effort, all he had to do was rock back and\nforth - it occurred to him how simple everything would be if somebody\ncame to help him.",
    "Nothing should be removed;\neverything had to stay; he could not do without the good influence the\nfurniture had on his condition; and if the furniture made it difficult\nfor him to crawl about mindlessly that was not a loss but a great\nadvantage.",
    "There was seldom any conversation, especially at\nfirst, that was not about him in some way, even if only in secret.",
    "Besides that, they had not been using up all the money that Gregor had\nbeen bringing home every month, keeping only a little for himself, so\nthat that, too, had been accumulating.",
    "But his sister was\nnot there, Gregor would have to do the job himself.",
    "That was the sort of totally pointless thing that went through his mind\nin his present state, pressed upright against the door and listening.",
    "So they couldn't\nunderstand his words any more, although they seemed clear enough to\nhim, clearer than before - perhaps his ears had become used to the sound.",
    "His main concern was for the loud noise he\nwas bound to make, and which even through all the doors would probably\nraise concern if not alarm.",
    "Gregor had almost entirely stopped eating.",
    "And, as if in confirmation of their new dreams and good\nintentions, as soon as they reached their destination Grete was the\nfirst to get up and stretch out her young body.",
    "The gentlemen\nbent over the dishes set in front of them as if they wanted to test the\nfood before eating it, and the gentleman in the middle, who seemed to\ncount as an authority for the other two, did indeed cut off a piece of\nmeat while it was still in its dish, clearly wishing to establish\nwhether it was sufficiently cooked or whether it should be sent back to\nthe kitchen.",
    "She happened to be\nholding the long broom in her hand, so she tried to tickle Gregor with\nit from the doorway.",
    "The washing up from\nbreakfast lay on the table; there was so much of it because, for\nGregor's father, breakfast was the most important meal of the day and\nhe would stretch it out for several hours as he sat reading a number of\ndifferent newspapers.",
    "She was still\na child of seventeen, her life up till then had been very enviable,\nconsisting of wearing nice clothes, sleeping late, helping out in the\nbusiness, joining in with a few modest pleasures and most of all\nplaying the violin.",
    "He would often lie there the whole night through, not sleeping a wink\nbut scratching at the leather for hours on end.",
    "Please, don't make my parents suffer!",
    "Nothing would stop Gregor's father as\nhe drove him back, making hissing noises at him like a wild man.",
    "And anyway, he wants to\nspeak to you personally.",
    "I don't know why I didn't let\nyou know at work!",
    "The whole of his left side seemed like one, painfully\nstretched scar, and he limped badly on his two rows of legs.",
    "Will you please just let me leave?",
    "Meanwhile, it had\nbecome very quiet in the next room.",
    "But Gregor had had no intention of frightening anyone, least of all his\nsister.",
    "He really did want to open the\ndoor, really did want to let them see him and to speak with the chief\nclerk; the others were being so insistent, and he was curious to learn\nwhat they would say when they caught sight of him.",
    "His back seemed to be quite hard, and probably nothing would happen to\nit falling onto the carpet.",
    "He\nrested there a little while to recover from the effort involved and\nthen set himself to the task of turning the key in the lock with his\nmouth.",
    "At the same time she became\ntouchy in a way that was quite new for her and which everyone in the\nfamily understood - cleaning up Gregor's room was for her and her alone.",
    "He got into the habit of\nclosely watching it for one or two hours before it was opened and then,\nlying in the darkness of his room where he could not be seen from the\nliving room, he could watch the family in the light of the dinner table\nand listen to their conversation - with everyone's permission, in a way,\nand thus quite differently from before.",
    "His father seemed to think it more\nimportant to calm the three gentlemen before driving Gregor out, even\nthough they were not at all upset and seemed to think Gregor was more\nentertaining than the violin playing had been.",
    "He was not even startled out of this state when the violin on\nhis mother's lap fell from her trembling fingers and landed loudly on\nthe floor.",
    "In this way they went round the room several times\nwithout anything decisive happening, without even giving the impression\nof a chase as everything went so slowly."
