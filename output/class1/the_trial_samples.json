    "Especially in a court like\nthis that seems to consist of nothing but woman-chasers.",
    "He\nexplained it all to me at length, but refused to do anything I asked\nfor, no-one has any influence on the way the trial proceeds, he said, to\ntry and insist on it in any of the documents submitted--like I was\nasking--was simply unheard of and would do harm to both him and me.",
    "Unfortunately, just then the servitor came in and\nreported that the director had sent him to see whether the chief clerk\nwas already in his office; if he was, then would he please be so kind\nas to come to his reception room as the gentleman from Italy was\nalready there.",
    "If you do it again I won't tell you\nanything else at all.",
    "K. listened to all of this,\ntesting it and thinking it over as if he had been given the task of\nclosely observing everything spoken here, inform a higher office about\nit and write a report.",
    "This time the girl\noffered no resistance.",
    "I expect the papers you gave him were\nvery hard to understand.\" \"Yes,\" said the lawyer, \"they certainly are\nthat.",
    "Josef!\" called his uncle once more, and he asked the\ngirl, \"It's trouble with his heart, is it?\" \"I think it is, sir,\" said\nthe girl, who by now had found time to go ahead with the candle and open\nthe door into the room.",
    "How are we to avoid those in office\nbecoming deeply corrupt when everything is devoid of meaning?",
    "The air was\nalso quite oppressive, there was no proper stairwell and the narrow\nsteps were closed in by walls on both sides with no more than a small,\nhigh window here and there.",
    "The supervisor didn't shake hands, he\nthought, and looked at the woman differently from before, examining her.",
    "K. had\nhardly turned towards the door, he had left it completely up to the\npainter whether and how he would place him under his protection if he\nwanted to.",
    "They\nstood on both sides of the stairs, pressing themselves against the wall\nso that K. could get through between them, and smoothed their aprons\ndown with their hands.",
    "You're letting him abuse you,' he\nsaid.",
    "I'll still help you, of course I\nwill, only now, now that the trial is already underway, it makes it\nvery difficult.",
    "And then you'd try and put in a complaint against me, too,\"\nsaid the whip-man, \"and get me flogged.",
    "It is simply that those who\nare facing a charge are the most attractive.",
    "It would have been inhumane to\nmake fun of that.",
    "He took hold of K. by both arms and shoved\nhim against the door as if he wanted to nail him to it.",
    "Despite this affirmation the painter summed it\nall up once more, as if he wanted to give K. something to console him on\nhis way home.",
    "K., I swear to God, but I'm going to have no\nchoice but to have a few words with Miss B\u00fcrstner about it myself.",
    "I didn't know,\" he said, \"that you\ncould take on a lawyer in matters like this.\" \"Well of course you can,\"\nsaid his uncle, \"that goes without saying.",
    "I was talking about your case with the\nmanufacturer yesterday, and he asked me if I wouldn't like to help you,\nand I answered: 'He can come and see me if he likes,' and now I'm\npleased to see you here so soon.",
    "K. had taken it as a matter of course that the manufacturer had\nexplained to the painter in his letter that K. wanted nothing more with\nhim than to find out more about his trial.",
    "Almost\neverything you've said so far has been things we could have taken from\nyour behaviour, even if you'd said no more than a few words.",
    "K. would also go, once a week, to see a\ngirl called Elsa who worked as a waitress in a wine bar through the\nnight until late in the morning.",
    "The only things of real value are honest personal contacts,\ncontacts with higher officials, albeit higher officials of the lower\ngrades, you understand.",
    "His uncle was bound to come, K. had been sure of that for about\na month.",
    "But he immediately\nrealised that that would be shockingly excessive, and there would even\nbe the suspicion that he was moving house because of the incidents of\nthat morning.",
    "K. did not quite\nunderstand whom he had in mind, it was moreover an odd expression to use\nand it took K. a little while to guess its meaning.",
    "I'm already tired,\" said Miss B\u00fcrstner.",
    "Especially here in front of the\nlawyer, where both of us, you and me, we're only tolerated because of\nhis charity.",
    "His naked, white-haired legs shivered in the cold.",
    "There's still a lot I\nneed to tell you.",
    "With varying degrees of\nsuccess, it must be said.",
    "As he took off his winter overcoat and also unbuttoned\nhis frock coat the painter said to him in apology, \"I must have warmth.",
    "Do you want to see his bedroom?\" she asked.",
    "He was hardly able to\ngive you an answer.",
    "Very well, I won't make the telephone call.\"\n\"You can call him if you want to,\" said the supervisor, stretching his\nhand out towards the outer room where the telephone was, \"please, go on,\ndo make your phone call.\" \"No, I don't want to any more,\" said K., and\nwent over to the window.",
    "Everything, floor, walls and ceiling,\nwas made of wood, between the planks narrow gaps could be seen.",
    "He watched her\nin irritation as Leni now took the candle from the businessman's\nhand--which he had been holding on to all this time--wiped his hand\nwith her apron and then knelt beside him to scratch off some wax that\nhad dripped from the candle onto his trousers.",
    "The rain had\neased off slightly but it was still damp, chilly and dark, it would be\ndifficult to see anything in the cathedral but standing about on cold\nflagstones might well make K.'s chill much worse.",
    "The student carried the woman up\nthese steps, and after the exertions of running with her he was soon\ngroaning and moving very slowly.",
    "Fortunately, though, behind the girl, the invalid raised himself up,\nK.'s uncle made an ugly face as if swallowing something disgusting and\nthen, somewhat calmer, said, \"We have naturally not lost our senses,\nnot yet; if what I am asking for were not possible I would not be asking\nfor it.",
    "What I will do is I will\ncall Block in, unlock the door and sit down here beside the bedside\ntable.\" \"Be glad to,\" said K., and did as the lawyer suggested; he was\nalways ready to learn something new.",
    "It sometimes seemed to him as if the\npainter was using these comments to make a favourable outcome to the\ntrial a precondition for his help, which of course would make the help\nitself unnecessary.",
    "Of course\nnot,\" said the painter, \"the second acquittal is followed by the third\narrest, the third acquittal by the fourth arrest and so on.",
    "Its purpose is to arrest\ninnocent people and wage pointless prosecutions against them which, as\nin my case, lead to no result.",
    "A woman's hands\nwill do many things when no-one's looking,\" he thought, he might himself\nhave smashed all the dishes on the spot but certainly would not have\nbeen able to carry it all out.",
    "Behind K. was the window through which the fog made it impossible to\nsee further than the snow covered roof of the neighbouring building.",
    "She gave him a tired nod, offered\nhim her hand to kiss as she turned away as if she did not know what she\nwas doing, and went back into her room with her head bowed.",
    "Only, without help from outside even that's impossible, but\nyou needn't worry about getting this help as I want to help you\nmyself.\" \"You understand a lot about this court and what sort of tricks\nare needed,\" said K. as he lifted her, since she was pressing in much\ntoo close to him, onto his lap.",
    "You were so friendly to me\nearlier on,\" said K., \"and you explained everything, but now you\nabandon me as if I were nothing to you.\" \"You have to go,\" said the\npriest.",
    "I'm quite happy to forgive you for it, as you ask, especially as\nI can't see anything at all that's been left untidy.\" With her hand laid\nflat on her lower hip, she made a tour around the room.",
    "I don't mean by this that the defendant is never free,\nhe's never free in the proper sense of the word with an apparent\nacquittal either.",
    "Whatever the cause, K. realised\nthat the possibility of communicating with the Italian had been largely\ntaken from him, even his French was difficult to understand, and his\nmoustache concealed the movements of his lips which might have offered\nsome help in understanding what he said.",
    "It's even possible that they will\npretend to be carrying on with the trial in the hope of receiving a\nlarge bribe, although I can tell you now that that will be quite in vain\nas I pay bribes to no-one.",
    "No-one stopped him doing this and he pushed\nhis sleeves back, felt his chest, straightened his hair, went over to\nthe three men, said, \"It makes no sense,\" at which these three turned\nround to face him and came towards him with serious expressions.",
    "K. was\nirritated all the more by this dumb helplessness which, seen from the\noutside, could have seemed like a kind of defiance on her part.",
    "At the end, speaking about the\nentrance he says, 'Now I'll go and close it,' although at the beginning\nof the story it says the door to the law is open as it always is, but if\nit's always open--always--that means it's open independently of the\nlifespan of the man it's intended for, and not even the doorkeeper will\nbe able to close it.",
    "He went straight to the painter, who lived in an outlying part of town\nwhich was very near to the court offices, although this area was even\npoorer, the houses were darker, the streets were full of dirt that\nslowly blew about over the half-melted snow.",
    "Even if\nhe had just some tiny success here it would still have a good effect on\nhis work at the bank for that day.",
    "But sitting in front of him\nand taken by surprise by his dismissal, K. would be able easily to\ninfer everything he wanted from the lawyer's face and behaviour, even if\nhe could not be induced to say very much.",
    "Block, the businessman--Dismissing the lawyer\n\nK. had at last made the decision to withdraw his defence from the\nlawyer.",
    "You were summoned,\" said the lawyer, \"but you have\nstill come at a bad time.\" Then, after a pause he added, \"You always\ncome at a bad time.\" When the lawyer started speaking Block had stopped\nlooking at the bed but stared rather into one of the corners, just\nlistening, as if the light from the speaker were brighter than Block\ncould bear to look at.",
    "But the\nwoman persuaded him by opening the door to the next room.",
    "The room\nthey've been allocated, with its narrow space and low ceiling, will be\nenough to show what contempt the court has for these people.",
    "But they're not in an easy position,\nto regard their positions as easy would be to do them an injustice.",
    "The two\npolicemen were entirely at the whip-man's mercy; he could have beaten\nthem to death.",
    "K. squeezed Leni's\nhand and Leni would sometimes dare to gently stroke K.'s hair.",
    "All\nthe while he had left his defence up to the lawyer his trial had had\nlittle basic affect on him, he had observed it from afar as something\nthat was scarcely able to reach him directly, when it suited him he\nlooked to see how things stood but he was also able to draw his head\nback again whenever he wanted.",
    "Oh!\" she exclaimed with a smile, thus making use of K.'s\ncomment to gain an advantage over him.",
    "I thank you for that,\" said\nK. \"but everyone else involved in these proceedings has something\nagainst me and presumes I'm guilty.",
    "After a certain point in\nthe proceedings,\" said the lawyer quietly and calmly, \"nothing new of\nany importance ever happens.",
    "So, we'll go into work now, shall we?\" The gentlemen laughed and\nnodded enthusiastically, as if that was what they had been waiting for\nall the time, except that K. had left his hat in his room so they all\ndashed, one after another, into the room to fetch it, which caused a\ncertain amount of embarrassment.",
    "Don't talk to me about Block,' he\nsaid.",
    "The director had, no doubt, seen\nthe anxiety in K.'s eyes as he tried to cope with this dialect of\nItalian, he joined in with this conversation in a way that was so\nadroit and unobtrusive that he seemed to be adding no more than minor\ncomments, whereas in fact he was swiftly and patiently breaking into\nwhat the Italian said so that K. could understand.",
    "He had hardly stepped into the hallway, finding\nhis bearings in the darkness with his hand still firmly holding the\ndoor, when another small hand, much smaller than K.'s own, placed itself\non his and gently shut the door.",
    "Anyway, so I heard one or two things but I can't really say\nthat it's about anything very serious.",
    "And then,\nsomething did indeed begin to move there in the corner.",
    "He had hardly pulled himself together when\nhe jumped over to Miss B\u00fcrstner and took her hand.",
    "I told you just now I've got five lawyers besides this one.",
    "We're all human beings here, one\nlike the other.\" \"That is true,\" said the priest, \"but that is how the\nguilty speak.\" \"Do you presume I'm guilty too?\" asked K.",
    "But he had come to him late and that lateness would bring still\nfurther difficulties, and not only where time was concerned.",
    "The policemen were still on K.'s mind all through the following day; he\nwas unable to concentrate on his work and had to stay in his office a\nlittle longer than the previous day so that he could finish it.",
    "The table was\nalready laid for a large number of people, as on Sundays almost all the\ntenants ate their dinner here at midday.",
    "There would be nothing heroic about it if he resisted, if he now caused\ntrouble for these gentlemen, if in defending himself he sought to enjoy\nhis last glimmer of life.",
    "The eternal light hung disturbingly\nin front of it.",
    "I once read a\ndescription of the difference between representing someone in ordinary\nlegal matters and in legal matters of this sort, and the writer\nexpressed it very well.",
    "This organisation even maintains a high-level judiciary\nalong with its train of countless servants, scribes, policemen and all\nthe other assistance that it needs, perhaps even executioners and\ntorturers--I'm not afraid of using those words.",
    "And besides, he\nhad hardly any idea what the conversation was about and his thoughts\nsoon turned to the care assistant and the ill treatment she had suffered\nfrom his uncle.",
    "It\nis a little odd, isn't it?\" \"I've been waiting for you since nine\no'clock.\" \"Well, I was at the theatre, I didn't know anything about you\nwaiting for me.\" \"The reason I need to speak to you only came up\ntoday.\" \"I see, well I don't see why not, I suppose, apart from being\nso tired I could drop.",
    "But before he\nhad reached the door the businessman spoke to him gently.",
    "So was a sermon to be given now?",
    "They came for me in the morning\nwhen I was still in bed.",
    "In the darkness, K. did not see at first what it was she wanted\nto show him, so she led his hand to it so that he could feel.",
    "It was not very encouraging, as the accused, to be\ntaken to a lawyer for poor people.",
    "It was\ndiscourteous of the Italian not to come but it was also sensible of him,\nthere would have been nothing to see, they would have had to content\nthemselves with seeking out a few pictures with K.'s electric pocket\ntorch and looking at them one small part at a time.",
    "How could any doorkeeper be\nmore faithful to his duty?",
    "Eventually, K. did stop following, he did not want to worry the old man\ntoo much, and he also did not want to frighten him away completely in\ncase the Italian turned up after all."
