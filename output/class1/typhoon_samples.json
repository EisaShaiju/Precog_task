    "Rout knew too well\nthe value of a good billet.",
    "None of us had a spell of\nany sort for nearly thirty hours, and there the old man sat rubbing his\nchin, rubbing the top of his head, and so bothered he didn't even think\nof pulling his long boots off.\n\n\"'I hope, sir,' says I, 'you won't be letting them out on deck before we\nmake ready for them in some shape or other.'
